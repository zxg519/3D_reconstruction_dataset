# 3D_reconstruction_datase
In this repo, we stores different batches of images for 3D reconstruction, those images are taken by ourself, and they are free to use.
1. house1: self-made dataset for 3D reconstruction, data collected by our team members
2. coffeeshack: cofffeeshack dataset originally downloaded from http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~hkim/mvs/dataset/, which is temperarily not be accessible
3. 


The test dataset are used in the following paper:
      Zhang X, Wang G, Gao Ye, et al., An Improved Building Reconstruction Algorithm Based on Manhattan-World Assumption and Line-Restricted Hypothetical Plane Fitting, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, xxxxxxxxxx

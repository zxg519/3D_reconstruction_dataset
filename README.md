# 3D_reconstruction_datase
In this repo, we store different batches of images for 3D reconstruction. All those images are taken by ourself or copied from other open dataset.
1. House1: self-made dataset for 3D reconstruction, data collected by our team members
2. House2: the dataset House2 is orignally from https://demuc.de/colmap/datasets/, which is a dataset of the opensource software colmap
3. Coffee shack: this dataset is originally from from http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~hkim/mvs/dataset/, which is temperarily not be accessible
4. Hall: the dataset hall is originally from http://mirror.openstreetmap.nl/sources/pmvs-2/data/hall/, which is a dataset of pmvs-2

The aforementioned test dataset are used in the following paper:
      Zhang X, Wang G, Gao Ye, et al., An Improved Building Reconstruction Algorithm Based on Manhattan-World Assumption and Line-Restricted Hypothetical Plane Fitting, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, xxxxxxxxxx
